  - [ ] Allowed Web Origins: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
  - [ ] Allowed Origins (CORS): `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### 5. Test Your Deployment

- [ ] Check the health endpoint: `https://your-project.vercel.app/health`
- [ ] Test the authentication flow:
  - [ ] Visit the login page: `https://your-project.vercel.app/auth/login`
  - [ ] Complete the Auth0 authentication
  - [ ] Verify the callback works
- [ ] Test API endpoints:
  - [ ] Check auth status: `https://your-project.vercel.app/auth/status`

## Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] Set up monitoring for your application
- [ ] Configure custom domain (if needed)
